## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This a project that we can mainly develop in HTML and CSS. However, I developed it in React using components and CSS for the styles. It was so useful to understand the HTML elements "figure" and "fig-caption". Also, in this project I used some parameters of the cards to define individual classes for each one.

Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

Regarding the functionality of this challenge in react, I used a component "Card" to avoid repeating code and to have a reusable component receiving parameters, and this content in a "Cards" component.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, Bootstrap, Tailwind among others.
